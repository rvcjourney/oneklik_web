//
//   active / frozen  — the normal app shell. They still have a product to use,

//   suspended /      — a standalone shell. AppLayout renders the product
//   banned             sidebar (Company Search, Lists, Buy Credits…), and
//                      offering that navigation to someone who is locked out of
//                      all of it would be actively misleading.
//
// The decision uses the same isLockedOut() helper as RequireAuth, so the two can
// never disagree about who is locked out — including the expired-suspension
// case, where the user is treated as active again.
